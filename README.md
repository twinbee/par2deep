## par2deep

Analogous to the various *deep commands (md5deep, hasdeep...) this tool serves to create, verify and repair parity files in an entire directory hierarchy.

This tool will generate one parity file (plus a file for the recovery blocks) per file that you protect. This makes it simple to move files if you change your mind on how your file tree must be organized. Just move the `par2` files along.

## Motivation

I chose to use the old but well tested and well known `par2` program to base this tool on, instead of similar tools such as `zfec`, `rsbep` or something like `pyFileFixity`. Some recent forks of `par2` have added recursive scanning abilities, but they're generally not cross-platform.

I use `par2deep` to secure my photos and music across drives, machines and operating systems, and I intend to keep securing my data this way in the decades to come. I felt that the wide availability of the `par2` tool was my best bet.

## Install

You can now use pip!

    $ pip(3) install par2deep (--user)

Or clone/download this repo and install manually with:

    $ python(3) setup.py install (--user)

Or run directly with:

    $ python par2deep

Alternatively, if you have installed the `cx_Freeze` package, you can generate an msi package for Windows. Adapt `setup_cx.py` to suit your needs (include the `par2` executable and, most importantly, the icon of your choice) and then build the `.msi` file in `/dist`:

    $ python setup_cx.py bdist_msi

## Usage

After installation, run with `par2deep` for the GUI or `par2deep-cli` if you live in the terminal. Command line options may be enumerated by using the --help option. Note that `-q` will update, fix or recreate parity files as it sees fit. If unrepairable damage is found, it will recreate parity data.

An optional `par2deep.ini` file may be placed in the target directory or as `~/.par2deep` defining all the commandline options. For the excludes, separate by comma.

Example `par2deep.ini`:

	excludes = [new, root]
	par_cmd = c:/sync/apps/par/par2.exe
